# QuadSmack Keebs
A Collection of Free to Build Keyboards and related Hardware and Software

The focus of QuadSmack Keebs is highly functional unique keyboards, typcailly "ergonomic" in some form. Some boards will be to solve a particular problem or fill a particular niche.

# Navigation

* Keyboards
  * [TestDrive Series](/TestDrive/README.md) - A set of minimal cost keyboard designs intended to lower the cost of trying different layouts.
 
  * [Talon38](/Talon38/README.md) - Talon 38 is a Handwired Split with Four Thumb keys and outer rows with 2 keys. Made with the inexpensive WaveShare RP2040-Zero, can be built quite inexpensively. Nearly as thin/low profile as a PCB Keeb but all handiwre. 

  * _Coming Soon_ [Mostly Printed Keyboard One](/MostlyPrinted_KBD1/README.md) - My first split ergo design. Aggressive pinky stagger and splay 3x5_4 layout, hotswap sockets, handwire based on cheap Raspberry PI Pico.

# Variant Requests
Looking for a variation of one of my existing designs? Maybe you need support for a different MCU, want to add or remove keys, or need wireless capability? You're welcome to request a variant!

Please use the [Variant Request template](https://github.com/jrussellsmyth/quadsmack_keebs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=variant&projects=&template=variant-request.yml) to submit your request. While I can't guarantee delivery or specific timelines, I'll do my best to honor requests as time and resources allow. Community involvement and detailed specifications help increase the likelihood of implementation.

All requests are considered and help guide the future direction of QuadSmack Keebs designs!
