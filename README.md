* Keyboards
  * [TestDrive Series](/TestDrive/README.md) - A set of minimal cost keyboard designs intended to lower the cost of trying different layouts.
 
  * [Talon38](/Talon38/README.md) - Talon 38 is a Handwired Split with Four Thumb keys and outer rows with 2 keys. Made with the inexpensive WaveShare RP2040-Zero, can be built quite inexpensively. Nearly as thin/low profile as a PCB Keeb but all handiwre. 

  * _Coming Soon_ [Mostly Printed Keyboard One](/MostlyPrinted_KBD1/README.md) - My first split ergo design. Aggressive pinky stagger and splay 3x5_4 layout, hotswap sockets, handwire based on cheap Raspberry PI Pico.
