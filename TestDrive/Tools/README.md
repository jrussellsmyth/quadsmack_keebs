# Assembly Tools
Here are some small tools that can make assembling a TestDrive keyboard a little easier.

* __DiodeClamp.stl__: - This is a plate to snap into the keywell after placing the diode. This holds the diode while you wrap the lead and makes the wrapping easier.
* __WirePusher.stl__: - A small tool to push the diode wire back through the board when wrapping
* __DiodeBender.stl__: A jig to pre-bend 5 diodes at a time to simplify installation.
* __WireWrapFixture.stl__: A tool to help twist the diode leg for the row connection. Add one M2x8 screw.
